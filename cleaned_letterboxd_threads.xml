⭐️ ★★★★½
There’s never a dull moment in Radio Days. A warm, funny, and beautifully woven love letter to a bygone era. The ensemble cast is excellent across the board, with fun appearance by Mia Farrow and a song by Diane Keaton. The film floats effortlessly through 90 minutes of pure nostalgic joy.

⭐️ ★★★★
Rob &amp; Fab come out of this film almost unhurt, if not entirely cleared. Charles Shaw, on the other hand, comes off pretty badly, acting like the guy who broke a deal he once benefited from, then cried foul when the spotlight turned elsewhere. Altogether, a good documentary on an astonishing and messy moment in pop culture.

⭐️ ★★★★
Peter Ustinov is at his most charming as Poirot. Supporting turns from Diana Rigg, Maggie Smith, and Denis Quilley are pitch-perfect. Cole Porter soundtrack is an inspired choice, beautifully reorchestrated to match the film’s vintage glamour.

⭐️ ★★★★
Nathan Lane is a whirlwind of emotion and timing, Robin Williams plays it with rare restraint, and Gene Hackman? Totally owning it. The atmosphere, the set design, the costumes, it’s all gloriously over-the-top but never off-key. A sparkling, sharp, and heartfelt remake that thrives on performance.

⭐️ ★★★
Deborah Kerr and John Kerr give sensitive, nuanced performances. While it carries that unmistakable old-fashioned atmosphere, it never quite reaches the dramatic highs of Douglas Sirk. The film runs a bit longer than necessary, and starts to stretch in places, but the strength of its story holds steady. Delicate, daring, and quietly powerful.

⭐️ ★★★★
Victim is a bold, ahead-of-its-time film that tackles its subject matter head-on. Dirk Bogarde delivers a quietly devastating performance, and the supporting cast, drawn from the finest of the British stage and screen, is uniformly excellent. A powerful, essential piece of cinema resplendent in its courage and craft.

⭐️ ★★½
The Ritz is chaotic, loud, and uneven. If it weren't for Rita Moreno’s gloriously over-the-top performance, it might not be watchable at all. The film has a few genuinely funny moments, but they’re too scattered to give it real momentum.

⭐️ ★★★★★
Rebecca is arguably Hitchcock's strongest early sound-era entry. From the first eerie shots of Manderley to the final blaze, this is unmistakably Hitchcock. The film bears his fingerprints in every frame, its meticulous cutting, haunting lighting, and elegant, psychological framing.

⭐️ ★★★½
Even as a standalone, this would’ve been a smash hit. The action is spectacular, the locations are stunning, and the set pieces are jaw-dropping. There’s strategy, suspense, and just the right dash of humor. Worth every cent of the ticket price and then some.

⭐️ ★★★½
Richard Lester’s take stands out for its sense of fun and camaraderie. The first part leans heavily on action, and while not all the fight sequences are particularly well executed. What really holds the film together is the star-studded cast, all clearly having a blast.
