⭐️ ★★★½
King Lear is proof that when you box him in, he doesn’t just push against the walls—he scrawls poetry all over them. It’s cryptic, messy, frustrating, and kind of brilliant.

⭐️ ★★★½
A solid variation on the gaslight thriller with a few twists along the way. Claudette Colbert is, as expected, excellent, graceful, expressive, and totally believable as a woman being driven to the brink. The film leans more into melodrama than menace, but it works, thanks to its noirish atmosphere and a plot that keeps things moving. Not quite Gaslight, but an entertaining ride nonetheless.

⭐️ ★★★★
Gary Cooper feels a bit miscast at first, but somehow, it works, especially when playing off the magnifique and always impeccable Claudette Colbert. Their dynamic fuels this sharp, subdued comedy, packed with excellent one-liners and a delightfully unhinged final act that leans fully into screwball chaos. Not as flashy as other Lubitsch gems, but still a witty, playful delight.

⭐️ ★★★
Still very much stuck in its stage origins, with a theatrical mise en scène that sometimes holds it back. A bit too heavy on the slapstick, and it tries a little too hard to be funny, but there are some genuinely great one-liners scattered throughout. Feels like a rough draft of Annie Hall and Manhattan, with all the neuroses but not quite the finesse. Cute, though.

⭐️ ★★★★
Hairspray delivers where it counts: big songs, big energy, and a big heart . A feel-good musical that knows exactly what it is and has a blast doing it .

⭐️ ★★★½
The script is pure fluff, what flies on stage just can't quite land on screen, but if you let go of logic and lean into the chaos, the ensemble cast pulls you in . A glorious mess, and kind of irresistible .

⭐️ ★★★★½
This time around, we actually get actors who can sing, and the ABBA songs finally feel like they serve the story instead of fighting it . Pierce Brosnan redeems himself with an unexpectedly moving a cappella version of "SOS"

⭐️ ★★★★
It’s light, it’s witty, and the supporting cast adds a lot of flavor . The whole Sally Michaels subplot? Totally contrived and a bit of a buzzkill, casting an odd shadow over an otherwise bubbly film .

⭐️ ★★½
Not much to say about this one : Rock Hudson is doing his usual Rock Hudsoning, and Gina Lollobrigida looks great but brings little depth to the role. Bobby Darin doesn’t shine much as an actor, though at least he gets to sing. What makes it worth a look? The stunning on-location shots, a scene-stealing turn by Walter Slezak, and the film debut of a young Joel Grey. A gentle, harmless comedy that coasts more than it dazzles.

⭐️ ★★
A kind of revue-style film where the musical numbers easily take up half the runtime . A minstrel scene that hasn't aged well, making it more of a historical curiosity than essential viewing .

⭐️ ★★★
There is some fantastic never-before-seen footage and the story is decently told, but there’s surprisingly little in terms of full performances . Darren Criss pops in like he accidentally wandered onto the set when the lights were already on .

⭐️ ★★★★½
Some films are carried by dialogue and acting so gripping, so razor-sharp, that the mise en scène fades into the background, and Garde à vue is one of them. Ventura and Serrault deliver a masterclass in tension, their face-off hypnotic and relentless. Everything else is stripped down, almost ghostly, so much so that even Romy Schneider feels like an apparition drifting through the fog. A haunting tour de force.

⭐️ ★★½
The script is uninspired, the pacing drags, and Joanna Shimkus’ character lacks depth or charm . Franois de Roubaix’s haunting, melancholic score breathes any real life into the film .

⭐️ ★★★½
Arabesque is clearly an exercise in style, and thankfully, Stanley Donen brings enough of it to keep the whole thing afloat . The real saving grace? The magnetic chemistry between the stunning Sophia Loren and the ever-charming Gregory Peck .

Depardieu, in particular, delivers one of his finest performances . A stunning first chapter, full of heartbreak and quiet tragedy . Incredible acting from Depardieu, Auteuil, and Montand .

⭐️ ★★★★
The second part loses quite a bit in intensity, though it never loses its grip entirely . A softer, less devastating follow-up, but still a powerful close to the story .

⭐️ ★★★½
Compelling performance from Dean Stockwell, who anchors this suspenseful and tightly directed drama with eerie precision. The tension builds slowly but effectively, and when Welles finally appears in the final act, he absolutely steals the show. delivering a monologue that’s as riveting as it is unforgettable. A gripping courtroom drama with atmosphere, nuance, and standout acting.

⭐️ ★★★★★
Every element of artistry blends in perfect unison: the music, the saturated sets, the lighting, the compositions... it all sings (literally and visually) Demy creates something that’s less a narrative than a cinematic ballet, where the acting, songs, and mise en scne flow so seamlessly you’re never bored for a second .

⭐️ ★★
This latest in a long line of Gene Kelly documentaries plays it frustratingly safe . It tiptoes around anything remotely controversial, and worse, sprinkles in some factual errors along the way .

The film rests comfortably on its casting: Laure Calamy’s deadpan delivery steals the best lines . Dubosc is surprisingly touching as the simple soul, and Poelvoorde is, well, peak Poelvoorde .

⭐️ ★★★
The tone shifts drastically, campier, looser, and clearly paving the way for the Moore era . Still, despite its flaws, it’s an entertaining romp that keeps the Bond formula alive and kicking, with a wink .

What really makes my blood boil is that they had to return their Grammy awards .  Milli Vanilli was an act, and Rob &amp; Fab were part of that act . Honestly, Rob &amp; Fab come out of this film almost unhurt, if not entirely cleared .

Peter Ustinov is at his most charming as Poirot, and supporting turns from Diana Rigg, Maggie Smith, and Denis Quilley are pitch-perfect . Cole Porter soundtrack is an inspired choice, beautifully reorchestrated to match the film’s vintage glamour .
