⭐️ ★★★½
Godard with a blank check? Chaos. Godard with restrictions? Pure alchemy. King Lear is proof that when you box him in, he doesn’t just push against the walls—he scrawls poetry all over them. Forced to deliver, he makes something that barely resembles a play, yet somehow captures the essence of a world unraveling, where language and meaning dissolve into static. It’s cryptic, messy, frustrating, and kind of brilliant. Godard mutters

⭐️ ★★★½
A solid variation on the gaslight thriller with a few twists along the way. Claudette Colbert is, as expected, excellent, graceful, expressive, and totally believable as a woman being driven to the brink. The film leans more into melodrama than menace, but it works, thanks to its noirish atmosphere and a plot that keeps things moving. Not quite Gaslight, but an entertaining ride nonetheless.

⭐️ ★★★★
Gary Cooper feels a bit miscast at first, but somehow, it works, especially when playing off the magnifique and always impeccable Claudette Colbert. Their dynamic fuels this sharp, subdued comedy, packed with excellent one-liners and a delightfully unhinged final act that leans fully into screwball chaos. Not as flashy as other Lubitsch gems, but still a witty, playful delight.

⭐️ ★★★
Still very much stuck in its stage origins, with a theatrical mise en scène that sometimes holds it back. A bit too heavy on the slapstick, and it tries a little too hard to be funny, but there are some genuinely great one-liners scattered throughout. Feels like a rough draft of Annie Hall and Manhattan, with all the neuroses but not quite the finesse. Cute, though.

⭐️ ★★★★
It might run a little longer than it needs to, but Hairspray delivers where it counts: big songs, big energy, and a big heart. The music is broad and catchy, the message is clear without being heavy-handed, and above all, it’s just plain entertaining. And let’s be honest: Pfeiffer, Travolta, and Walken are having so much fun, it’s impossible not to be swept up in it. A feel-good musical that knows exactly what it is and has a blast

⭐️ ★★★½
It’s a great entertaining film that… doesn’t really work. And yet, it’s so much fun. The script is pure fluff, what flies on stage just can’t quite land on screen, but if you let go of logic and lean into the chaos, the ensemble cast pulls you in. The songs spiral around you until resistance is futile. Brosnan can’t sing? Honestly, none of them can (except Baranski, queen), but it doesn’t matter. ABBA’s genius carries it all. A glo

⭐️ ★★★★½
Here we are, specially written for the screen, and surprisingly, this sequel works much better than the first film. This time around, we actually get actors who can sing, and the ABBA songs finally feel like they serve the story instead of fighting it. Brosnan redeems himself (yes, really) with an unexpectedly moving a cappella version of “SOS,” and that final credit scene? Formidable. It’s vibrant, emotional, and

⭐️ ★★★★
There’s really nothing wrong with this feel-good romcom. Barrymore and Grant make a charming duo, full of spark and rhythm, and the songs are surprisingly catchy, Way Back Into Love is a legit earworm. It’s light, it’s witty, and the supporting cast adds a lot of flavor. The whole Sally Michaels subplot? Totally contrived and a bit of a buzzkill, casting an odd shadow over an otherwise bubbly film. But in the end, it’s great

⭐️ ★★½
Not much to say about this one: Rock Hudson is doing his usual Rock Hudsoning, and Gina Lollobrigida looks great but brings little depth to the role. Bobby Darin doesn’t shine much as an actor, though at least he gets to sing. What makes it worth a look? The stunning on-location shots, a scene-stealing turn by Walter Slezak, and the film debut of a young Joel Grey. A gentle, harmless comedy that coasts more than it dazzles.

⭐️ ★★
A kind of revue-style film where the musical numbers easily take up half the runtime, leaving a plot that’s about as thin as a postcard. It’s a spirited effort from Monogram Pictures, with plenty of toe-tapping moments, but not much narrative glue to hold it all together. There’s also a minstrel scene that hasn’t aged well, making it more of a historical curiosity than essential viewing. Still, if you’re here for the vintage

⭐️ ★★★
A not-so all-around documentary on Liza Minnelli, focusing mostly on her post-Garland 70s heyday and skimming over much of the rest. There is some fantastic never-before-seen footage and the story is decently told, but there’s surprisingly little in terms of full performances, which feels like a missed opportunity. And then there’s the mystery of Michael Feinstein’s omnipresence, why so much? Darren

⭐️ ★★★★½
Some films are carried by dialogue and acting so gripping, so razor-sharp, that the mise en scène fades into the background, and Garde à vue is one of them. Ventura and Serrault deliver a masterclass in tension, their face-off hypnotic and relentless. Everything else is stripped down, almost ghostly, so much so that even Romy Schneider feels like an apparition drifting through the fog. A haunting tour de force.

⭐️ ★★½
Les Aventuriers (1967) – ★★½ A film with a striking duo, Delon and Ventura light up the screen just by being there, but unfortunately, that’s about all it has going for it. The script is uninspired, the pacing drags, and Joanna Shimkus’ character lacks depth or charm. It all feels strangely flat. Only François de Roubaix’s haunting, melancholic score breathes any real life into the film. A missed opportunity saved, briefly,

⭐️ ★★★½
The script is lazy, Mancini’s score feels lazy, even Maurice Binder’s usually iconic opening titles seem a bit phoned in. Arabesque is clearly an exercise in style, and thankfully, Stanley Donen brings enough of it to keep the whole thing afloat. The real saving grace? The magnetic chemistry between the stunning Sophia Loren and the ever-charming Gregory Peck. It’s a must-watch, but probably only for those with an acquired taste for

⭐️ ★★★★½
Above all, it’s the exceptional acting from Depardieu, Auteuil, and Montand that elevates this film into masterpiece territory. The mood and atmosphere are beautifully crafted, wrapping the story in a melancholy that’s as poignant as it is powerful. Depardieu, in particular, delivers one of his finest performances: the tenacity, the quiet desperation in his eyes, the sheer physical presence of his character, it’s incredible

⭐️ ★★★★
The second part loses quite a bit in intensity, though it never loses its grip entirely. Auteuil and Montand remain the heart of the film, carrying much of the emotional weight. Béart and Girardot bring a welcome freshness, but it’s not quite enough to stop the plot from faltering here and there. What saves it is that the characters remain deeply compelling, you’re still invested in every look, every decision. A softer, le

⭐️ ★★★
Another thin-plot musical that mostly stays afloat thanks to its musical numbers. The trio of Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds, and Ann Miller is absolutely delightful that you’re left wishing they had more group numbers together. As for the sailor trio… well, they don’t quite reach Sinatra-Kelly-Munshin heights. Russ Tamblyn stands out for his jaw-dropping acrobatics, but otherwise, the charm is a bit uneven. Still, it’s breezy, colo

⭐️ ★★★½
Compelling performance from Dean Stockwell, who anchors this suspenseful and tightly directed drama with eerie precision. The tension builds slowly but effectively, and when Welles finally appears in the final act, he absolutely steals the show. Delivering a monologue that’s as riveting as it is unforgettable. A gripping courtroom drama with atmosphere, nuance, and standout acting.

Funny how I don’t even care that much about the story, and yet The Umbrellas of Cherbourg completely fascinates me. Every element of artistry blends in perfect unison: the music, the saturated sets, the lighting, the compositions… it all sings (literally and visually). Demy creates something that’s less a narrative than a cinematic ballet, where the acting, songs, and mise en scène flow so seamlessly you’re never b

⭐️ ★★
Neither here nor there, this latest in a long line of Gene Kelly documentaries plays it frustratingly safe. It tiptoes around anything remotely controversial, and worse, sprinkles in some factual errors along the way. There’s nothing new under the sun here: the same recycled interviews, the same well-worn clichés about Kelly’s charm and choreography. A missed opportunity to dig deeper into a complex, fascin

Is the story going backward or forward? Honestly, who can tell, and who even cares? The plot is barely there, just enough connective tissue to get from one glorious number to the next. But that’s all it needs, because the pairing of Ginger and Fred is the real magic. Their chemistry, timing, and elegance turn every scene into gold. Add in a few all-time classic songs making their debut here, and you’ve got a musical that’s not abo

⭐️ ★★★★★
Sure, it could use a bit of tightening, especially around the midway stretch, but honestly, who’s complaining when you’ve got Curtis, Lemmon, and Monroe firing on all cylinders? This mafia-laced romp is pure comedic gold, with razor-sharp timing, iconic lines, and just the right dose of absurdity. The trio’s chemistry is electric, and even when the plot meanders, the charm never lets up. A classic for a reason even if nobody

⭐️ ★★★
Somewhere between a mild comedy, a mild thriller, and a mild Christmas movie it never pushes anything too far, but it doesn’t need to. The film rests comfortably on its casting: Laure Calamy’s deadpan delivery steals the best lines, Dubosc is surprisingly touching as the simple soul, and Poelvoorde is, well, peak Poelvoorde. Never boring, gently amusing, and oddly compelling from start to finish. A soft little gem with ju

I probably wouldn’t have given this a second glance if it weren’t for the sheer star power of Katharine Hepburn, and what a force she is. Her delivery is razor-sharp, commanding every scene with intelligence and fire. But she’s not alone: the cast is stacked, and no one falls short, especially Peter O’Toole, who matches her blow for blow.

⭐️ ★★★
Coming off the elegance and emotional weight of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, it’s hard not to see Diamonds Are Forever as a step down. The tone shifts drastically, campier, looser, and clearly paving the way for the Moore era. It’s still a fun ride, with solid action and plenty of classic Bond flair, but Connery feels… off. Believable, sure, but a little rusty and visibly less invested. Still, despite its flaws, it’s a

There’s never a dull moment in Radio Days. Whether it’s the charmingly odd vignettes or the constant stream of toe-tapping period music, the film floats effortlessly through 90 minutes of pure nostalgic joy. The ensemble cast is excellent across the board, with fun appearance by Mia Farrow and a song by Diane Keaton, but it’s Dianne Wiest who absolutely steals the show.

Never heard of this band before watching this, but what a great story this is. What really makes my blood boil is that they had to return their Grammy awards.

While it takes a few liberties, trimming characters, tweaking the plot, and adding a dash of humour. Evil Under the Sun remains one of the finest Poirot adaptations out there. Faithful in spirit, impeccably cast, and paced with precision, it never drags for a moment. Peter Ustinov is at his most charming as Poirot, and supporting turns from Diana Rigg, Maggie Smith, and Denis Quilley are pitch-perfect. The Cole Porter sound

While it doesn’t really add anything new to La Cage aux Folles, even sticking closely to its original resolution, The Birdcage more than earns its place thanks to its cast and pitch-perfect character work.

While it carries that unmistakable old-fashioned atmosphere, it never quite reaches the dramatic highs of Douglas Sirk, but it does carry the unmistakable scent of Vincente Minnelli.

Victim is a bold, ahead-of-its-time film that tackles its subject matter head-on, with a clarity and lack of bias that’s still impressive today. It doesn’t skirt around the issue, it faces it, with intelligence, restraint, and integrity. Dirk Bogarde delivers a quietly devastating performance, and the supporting cast, drawn from the finest of the British stage and screen, is uniformly excellent. A powerful, essential piece of cinema.

Silly is the word. The Ritz is chaotic, loud, and uneven, and if it weren’t for Rita Moreno’s gloriously over-the-top performance, it might not be watchable at all. She steals every scene she’s in, injecting just enough energy to keep things afloat. The film has a few genuinely funny moments, but they’re too scattered to give it real momentum. As a whole, it doesn’t quite stand on its own, but Moreno makes it worth sitting through. Ju

Hitchcock may have insisted Rebecca isn’t a true “Hitchcock picture,” but that claim does the film a disservice. Sure, he didn’t yet have the creative freedom he’d later enjoy, but the film bears his fingerprints in every frame, its meticulous cutting, haunting lighting, and elegant, psychological framing. Shooting short allowed him to assert his vision subtly but powerfully, transforming Daphne du Maurier’s gothic romance into somet

⭐️ ★★★½
Even as a standalone, this would’ve been a smash hit. Watching this, you instantly get why Mission: Impossible continues to work, it’s the kind of film that justifies the big screen. The action is spectacular, the locations are stunning, and the set pieces are jaw-dropping. But what makes it click is that it’s not just explosions, there’s strategy, suspense, and just the right dash of humor. It’s 150

⭐️ ★★★½
When you think of Dumas’ Three Musketeers, you picture epic storytelling and dazzling swordplay, but Richard Lester’s take stands out for something else: its sense of fun and camaraderie. That light, almost anarchic energy is what gives the film its personality. The first part leans heavily on action, and while not all the fight sequences are particularly well executed, when they are done with humor and flair, like the ta

⭐️ ★★★½
If The Three Musketeers was the brawn, The Four Musketeers is definitely the brain, and maybe even the heart. The intrigues deepen, the affairs of the heart take center stage, and the tone shifts slightly toward something more mature, more cunning. It’s a natural continuation of the first film, picking up exactly where it left off, and it works well as a companion piece. The cast is still perfectly in tune, and while the s

⭐️ ★★★★
On a more attentive rewatch, The Paradine Case reveals itself as very much a Hitchcock film. The story is gripping, layered with emotional tension and moral ambiguity, and the cast, Gregory Peck, Valli, Ann Todd, Charles Laughton, is perfectly assembled. Hitchcock keeps a discreet hand here, but his touch is unmistakable: the camera movements, the framing, the subtle psychological cues. His usual “gimmicks” are scattered thr

⭐️ ★★★★
There’s no duo more iconic, or more gloriously volatile, than Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, and this film leans into that with deliciously camp energy. The story? Wildly over-the-top. But it works, entirely thanks to the sheer star power and commitment of its leads. Davis is unhinged brilliance, Crawford is all tragic restraint, and together they make every minute gripping. It’s not the greatest film ever mad

⭐️ ★★½
In yet another attempt to mine the legacy of P. Ramlee, Megat Sharizal does bring a fresh and intriguing angle to the table, but unfortunately, the plot thins out far too early and never quite recovers. What starts with promise quickly turns into a slog: no character development, no narrative hooks, and an over-melodramatic tone that feels more self-aware than sincere (perhaps too meta for its own good). The underscore is relent

⭐️ ★★★½
With a delightfully quirky script by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, Midnight is a breezy, elegant screwball comedy that slips in just a touch of suspense for good measure. Claudette Colbert is, once again, perfect, sharp, funny, and utterly magnetic. She proves herself a masterful comedienne without missing a beat. The supporting cast is equally well chosen, each adding to the film’s charm. While the direction isn’t without its r

⭐️ ★★★½
I’ve got a bit of a love-hate thing with this one. On paper, it’s musical heaven: Crosby, Sinatra, and Kelly, with Cole Porter songs and VistaVision-Technicolor glam, but in practice, the trio never quite gels. Their styles clash more than blend: Crosby’s coasting on old charm, Sinatra only really comes alive when crooning, and Grace Kelly’s performance feels oddly forced, like she’s trying to prove she belongs in a comedy.

⭐️ ★★★★½
The western that started it all, or at least the one that set the blueprint for everything that followed. Stagecoach isn’t just a genre-defining film; it’s a masterclass in ensemble storytelling, where every archetype is born: the fallen woman with a heart of gold (the wonderful Claire Trevor), the drunk but wise doctor, the Southern gentleman, the timid salesman, and of course, the valorous yet misunderstood outlaw, played with s

⭐️ ★★★★★
First off, we’re dealing with noir royalty here, Glenn Ford in full tough-but-decent mode, and Gloria Grahame as the ultimate tragic noir dame: sharp, wounded, unforgettable. It’s classic Columbia Noir through and through, but what elevates it into something greater is Fritz Lang’s masterful direction. Under Lang’s eye, the camera doesn’t just follow, it choreographs the story. Every angle, every flicker of light and shadow is d

⭐️ ★★★
100 minutes of non-stop, absurd misadventure, After Hours is the kind of film that makes you laugh, squirm, and question reality, all at once. It’s a Kafkaesque fever dream of New York at its weirdest, where everything that can go wrong does, and then spirals even further. Scorsese’s direction is razor-sharp, full of kinetic energy and pitch-black humor. Griffin Dunne is excellent, anchoring the chaos with a performance that’s both

⭐️ ★★★
A slice of life about death, without a trace of morbidity. Chan’s Weeping Birds is a tender, contemplative love letter to both life and its inevitable end. It feels like a suspended moment in time, intimate and quiet, somewhere between cinéma vérité and poetic fiction, RTBF’s Strip Tease, but scripted with care and purpose. The strength of the short lies entirely in its “mains”, both the leads, and the hands-on detail in every fr

⭐️ ★★★★½
This one hits close to home. It’s not just one of Truffaut’s best, it’s already a towering achievement from his very first feature. The 400 Blows is raw and deeply personal, which makes it hard to watch at times, but impossible not to appreciate. Jean-Pierre Léaud is effortlessly convincing as Antoine Doinel, capturing a complex mix of defiance, sensitivity, and confusion without ever feeling forced. His parents are perfectly c

⭐️ ★★★
Home James is less a personal journey through James Mason’s hometown and more a documentary snapshot of then-contemporary Huddersfield: its industry, its rhythms, its people. The characters are colourful, the civic pride palpable, and the local success stories genuinely interesting. But let’s be honest: the real draw here is Mason himself. That voice, warm, wry, endlessly listenable, guides the film with such charm that you’d happ

⭐️ ★★★½
Marie Gillain and Gérard Depardieu make a surprisingly effective duo in this very ’90s French comedy that gleefully stretches the bounds of realism. It’s a snapshot of a more carefree era, sun-drenched, mischievous, and occasionally disarmingly emotional. The comedy lands more often than not, with a mix of farce and tenderness that gives it a unique charm. That said, the premise is undeniably problematic through a modern le

⭐️ ★★★★
Antoine Doinel is learning to live, and to love, in this bittersweet and charming sequel, where Truffaut reunites with Jean-Pierre Léaud to explore the messiness of youth, romance, and growing up. The film unfolds through a series of whimsical, often hilarious vignettes, all loosely bound by the evolving relationship between Antoine and Christine. It’s classic Truffaut: deeply human, full of affection for his characters, and pep

⭐️ ★★★★½
Truffaut’s own Rear Window, but instead of suspense, it’s filled with the poetry of everyday life. Bed and Board is arguably the most exhilarating of the Doinel films, buzzing with charm, energy, and that unmistakable Truffaut wit. Jean-Pierre Léaud is at his absolute best here, capturing Antoine’s quirks, restlessness, and endearing flaws with effortless nuance. Claude Jade returns with her grounded warmth, providing a perfect
