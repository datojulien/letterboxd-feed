⭐️ ★★★½
King Lear is proof that when you box him in, he doesn’t just push against the walls—he scrawls poetry all over them. Forced to deliver, he makes something that barely resembles a play, yet somehow captures the essence of a world unraveling. It’s cryptic, messy, frustrating, and kind of brilliant.

⭐️ ★★★½
A solid variation on the gaslight thriller with a few twists along the way. Claudette Colbert is, as expected, excellent, graceful, expressive, and totally believable as a woman being driven to the brink. The film leans more into melodrama than menace, but it works, thanks to its noirish atmosphere and a plot that keeps things moving. Not quite Gaslight, but an entertaining ride nonetheless.

⭐️ ★★★★
Gary Cooper feels a bit miscast at first, but somehow, it works, especially when playing off the magnifique and always impeccable Claudette Colbert. Their dynamic fuels this sharp, subdued comedy, packed with excellent one-liners and a delightfully unhinged final act that leans fully into screwball chaos. Not as flashy as other Lubitsch gems, but still a witty, playful delight.

⭐️ ★★★
Still very much stuck in its stage origins, with a theatrical mise en scène that sometimes holds it back. A bit too heavy on the slapstick, and it tries a little too hard to be funny, but there are some genuinely great one-liners scattered throughout. Feels like a rough draft of Annie Hall and Manhattan, with all the neuroses but not quite the finesse. Cute, though.

⭐️ ★★★★
The musical has big songs, big energy, and a big heart. Pfeiffer, Travolta, and Walken are having so much fun, it’s impossible not to be swept up in it. A feel-good musical that knows exactly what it is and has a blast doing it.

⭐️ ★★★½
The film is a glorious mess, and kind of irresistible. The songs spiral around you until resistance is futile. ABBA’s genius carries it all. The script is pure fluff, what flies on stage just can’t quite land on screen. If you let go of logic and lean into the chaos, the ensemble cast pulls you in.

Here We Go Again</title><updated>2025-03-31T09:14:33+00:00</updated><content type="text">🎥 Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, 2018
⭐️ ★★★★½
This time around, we actually get actors who can sing, and the ABBA songs finally feel like they serve the story instead of fighting it. Brosnan redeems himself with an unexpectedly moving a cappella version of “SOS,” and that final credit scene? Formidable.

⭐️ ★★★★
There’s really nothing wrong with this feel-good romcom. Barrymore and Grant make a charming duo, full of spark and rhythm. The songs are surprisingly catchy, Way Back Into Love is a legit earworm. The whole Sally Michaels subplot? Totally contrived and a bit of a buzzkill.

⭐️ ★★½
Not much to say about this one : Rock Hudson is doing his usual Rock Hudsoning, and Gina Lollobrigida looks great but brings little depth to the role. Bobby Darin doesn’t shine much as an actor, though at least he gets to sing. What makes it worth a look? The stunning on-location shots, a scene-stealing turn by Walter Slezak, and the film debut of a young Joel Grey. A gentle, harmless comedy that coasts more than it dazzles.

⭐️ ★★
The musical numbers easily take up half the runtime, leaving a plot that's about as thin as a postcard. There's also a minstrel scene that hasn't aged well, making it more of a historical curiosity than essential viewing. Still, if you're here for the vintage tunes, you'll find a few gems.

⭐️ ★★★
There is some fantastic never-before-seen footage and the story is decently told. There’s surprisingly little in terms of full performances, which feels like a missed opportunity. Darren Criss pops in like he accidentally wandered onto the set when the lights were already on. Worth a watch for the fans, but far from definitive.

⭐️ ★★★★½
Some films are carried by dialogue and acting so gripping, so razor-sharp, that the mise en scène fades into the background, and Garde à vue is one of them. Ventura and Serrault deliver a masterclass in tension, their face-off hypnotic and relentless. Everything else is stripped down, almost ghostly, so much so that even Romy Schneider feels like an apparition drifting through the fog. A haunting tour de force.

⭐️ ★★½
A film with a striking duo, Delon and Ventura light up the screen just by being there. The script is uninspired, the pacing drags, and Joanna Shimkus’ character lacks depth or charm. Only François de Roubaix’s haunting, melancholic score breathes any real life into the film.

⭐️ ★★★½
Arabesque is clearly an exercise in style, and thankfully, Stanley Donen brings enough of it to keep the whole thing afloat. The real saving grace? The magnetic chemistry between the stunning Sophia Loren and the ever-charming Gregory Peck. It’s a must-watch, but probably only for those with an acquired taste for slick, plot-light 60s capers.

⭐️ ★★★★½
The mood and atmosphere are beautifully crafted, wrapping the story in a melancholy that's as poignant as it is powerful. Above all, it's the exceptional acting from Depardieu, Auteuil, and Montand that elevates this film into masterpiece territory. A stunning first chapter, full of heartbreak and quiet tragedy.

⭐️ ★★★★
The second part loses quite a bit in intensity, though it never loses its grip entirely. Auteuil and Montand remain the heart of the film, carrying much of the emotional weight. Béart and Girardot bring a welcome freshness, but it's not quite enough to stop the plot from faltering here and there.

⭐️ ★★★
The trio of Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds, and Ann Miller is absolutely delightful that you're left wishing they had more group numbers together. Russ Tamblyn stands out for his jaw-dropping acrobatics, but otherwise, the charm is a bit uneven. Still, it’s breezy, colourful fun if you're here for the song-and-dance.

⭐️ ★★★½
Compelling performance from Dean Stockwell, who anchors this suspenseful and tightly directed drama with eerie precision. The tension builds slowly but effectively, and when Welles finally appears in the final act, he absolutely steals the show. delivering a monologue that’s as riveting as it is unforgettable. A gripping courtroom drama with atmosphere, nuance, and standout acting.

⭐️ ★★★★★
Every element of artistry blends in perfect unison. Demy creates something that’s less a narrative than a cinematic ballet. The acting, songs, and mise en scène flow so seamlessly you’re never bored for a second. Its magic only deepens with each rewatch.

⭐️ ★★
Gene Kelly biopic plays it frustratingly safe. It tiptoes around anything remotely controversial, and worse, sprinkles in some factual errors along the way. There’s nothing new under the sun here: the same recycled interviews, the same well-worn clichés.

⭐️ ★★★★½
The plot is barely there, just enough connective tissue to get from one glorious number to the next. The pairing of Ginger and Fred is the real magic. Their chemistry, timing, and elegance turn every scene into gold. Add in a few all-time classic songs making their debut here, and you’ve got a musical that’s not about the story.

⭐️ ★★★★★
This mafia-laced romp is pure comedic gold, with razor-sharp timing, iconic lines, and just the right dose of absurdity. The trio’s chemistry is electric, and even when the plot meanders, the charm never lets up. A classic for a reason even if nobody's… nah, I ain’t gonna say it.

⭐️ ★★★
The film rests comfortably on its casting. Laure Calamy’s deadpan delivery steals the best lines. Dubosc is surprisingly touching as the simple soul. Poelvoorde is never boring, gently amusing, and oddly compelling from start to finish. A soft little gem with just enough bite.

⭐️ ★★★★
The film runs a bit long and the plot can get tedious, but the verbal sparring and ensemble chemistry make it worth every minute. The cast is stacked, and no one falls short, especially Peter O’Toole, who matches her blow for blow. A powerhouse showcase of acting at its finest.

⭐️ ★★★
Diamonds Are Forever is an entertaining romp that keeps the Bond formula alive and kicking, with a wink. It's still a fun ride, with solid action and plenty of classic Bond flair, but Connery feels… off. Believable, sure, but a little rusty and visibly less invested. The tone shifts drastically, campier, looser and clearly paving the way for the Moore era.

⭐️ ★★★★½
There’s never a dull moment in Radio Days. A warm, funny, and beautifully woven love letter to a bygone era. The ensemble cast is excellent across the board, with fun appearance by Mia Farrow and a song by Diane Keaton. The film floats effortlessly through 90 minutes of pure nostalgic joy.

⭐️ ★★★★
Rob &amp; Fab come out of this film almost unhurt, if not entirely cleared. Charles Shaw, on the other hand, comes off pretty badly, acting like the guy who broke a deal he once benefited from, then cried foul when the spotlight turned elsewhere. Altogether, a good documentary on an astonishing and messy moment in pop culture.

⭐️ ★★★★
Peter Ustinov is at his most charming as Poirot. Supporting turns from Diana Rigg, Maggie Smith, and Denis Quilley are pitch-perfect. Cole Porter soundtrack is an inspired choice, beautifully reorchestrated to match the film’s vintage glamour.

⭐️ ★★★★
Nathan Lane is a whirlwind of emotion and timing, Robin Williams plays it with rare restraint, and Gene Hackman? Totally owning it. The atmosphere, the set design, the costumes, it’s all gloriously over-the-top but never off-key. A sparkling, sharp, and heartfelt remake that thrives on performance.

⭐️ ★★★
Deborah Kerr and John Kerr give sensitive, nuanced performances. While it carries that unmistakable old-fashioned atmosphere, it never quite reaches the dramatic highs of Douglas Sirk. The film runs a bit longer than necessary, and starts to stretch in places, but the strength of its story holds steady. Delicate, daring, and quietly powerful.

⭐️ ★★★★
Victim is a bold, ahead-of-its-time film that tackles its subject matter head-on. Dirk Bogarde delivers a quietly devastating performance, and the supporting cast, drawn from the finest of the British stage and screen, is uniformly excellent. A powerful, essential piece of cinema resplendent in its courage and craft.

⭐️ ★★½
The Ritz is chaotic, loud, and uneven. If it weren't for Rita Moreno’s gloriously over-the-top performance, it might not be watchable at all. The film has a few genuinely funny moments, but they’re too scattered to give it real momentum.

⭐️ ★★★★★
Rebecca is arguably Hitchcock's strongest early sound-era entry. From the first eerie shots of Manderley to the final blaze, this is unmistakably Hitchcock. The film bears his fingerprints in every frame, its meticulous cutting, haunting lighting, and elegant, psychological framing.

⭐️ ★★★½
Even as a standalone, this would’ve been a smash hit. The action is spectacular, the locations are stunning, and the set pieces are jaw-dropping. There’s strategy, suspense, and just the right dash of humor. Worth every cent of the ticket price and then some.

⭐️ ★★★½
Richard Lester’s take stands out for its sense of fun and camaraderie. The first part leans heavily on action, and while not all the fight sequences are particularly well executed. What really holds the film together is the star-studded cast, all clearly having a blast.
🔗 https://letterboxd.com/julienpierre/film/the-three-musketeers-1973/1/ #FilmReview</content><link href="https://letterboxd.com/julienpierre/film/the-three-musketeers-1973/1/"/></entry><entry><id>letterboxd-review-913511223#threads</id><title>The Four Musketeers</title><updated>2025-06-11T13:15:48+00:00</updated><content type="text">🎥 The Four Musketeers, 1974
⭐️ ★★★½
The intrigues deepen, the affairs of the heart take center stage, and the tone shifts slightly toward something more mature, more cunning. The cast is still perfectly in tune, and while the sword fights remain a bit scrappy, they carry that same Lester flair. Michel Legrand’s score is probably one of his laziest efforts, sadly.
